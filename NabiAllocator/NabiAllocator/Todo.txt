This project is my dissertation! (hopefully...)

Tasks:

*Long Term
- Make NabiAllocator a single header (or single .h+.inl+.cpp...) library once it's finished. This will make it easier to export / other people to benchmark.
- Bump the version to 1.0! (Core/Inc/Version.h)

- Profile the use of __forceinline on: (i have never used forceinline before, so it will be interesting to see)
	- BitOperations

*General
- Should we have the "Memory" folders/filters? Or should it be called something else
	- Because the whole project is just for the allocator, we dont have to bury things all inside a 'memory' folder...
